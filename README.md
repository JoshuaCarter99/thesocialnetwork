# The Social Network


## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to use my familiarity with Node, mongoose, Insomnia, and much more to create a deployable API that could fulfill different requests through the Insomnia application.
- I built this project to display what I have learned about Node, mongoose/mongo, Insomnia, and all .js directories in accordance with one another.
- The problem solved within the challenge was verifying that the API data could be properly used by Insomnia and that the data could be properly deployed onto a localhost so the data could be accessed.
- I learned how to deploy an API (Part 2)!!!
